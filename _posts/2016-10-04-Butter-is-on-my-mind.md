Hi everyone; my name is Kirara.

I am a 23-year old living in Philly, who is a Digital Scholarship Coordinator by day, and a sales associate at my local Anthropologie by night. What does that mean? It means that I work at the Van Pelt Library, and collaborating with my co-worker Yumi Shiroma, and my supervisor, Laurie Allen, we hold bi-weekly meetings where we show a cohort of 8 undergrads the ins and outs of how to use digital tools to further their research. Aside from this, I emmerse myself in boho-chic apparel and come home smelling like [Volcano Candles](http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/A19851559.jsp#/).
